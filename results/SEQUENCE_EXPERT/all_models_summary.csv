This is characterized by a limiting membrane enclosing smaller intraluminal vesicles (ILVs).\n    *   **Slice 1 (z187):** The MVB appears as two large, associated vesicular profiles. The lower vesicle contains a small membrane invagination, which is the nascent stage of an ILV. To the left of the MVB, a C-shaped membrane (a phagophore or isolation membrane) and a smaller, fully enclosed double-membraned vesicle (a nascent autophagosome) are visible. This complex suggests active autophagy is occurring in proximity to, or in the process of fusing with, the endosomal system.\n    *   **Slice 2 (z192):** The overall structure is maintained. The invagination within the lower vesicle is more pronounced. The associated autophagosome to the left is clearly defined, showcasing its characteristic double membrane.\n    *   **Slice 3 (z197):** The invagination in the lower vesicle has fully pinched off, now appearing as a distinct ILV. The upper large vesicle is slightly smaller in diameter, indicating that we are moving towards the edge of this structure in the z-axis.

The sequence clearly captures a snapshot of ILV formation within an MVB.\n\n2.  **Continuity of Corner Structures:**\n    The prompt asks to verify double-membrane structures in the corners. Upon close inspection, the most prominent and consistent structures are not double-membraned organelles but **cytoskeletal filaments**, likely actin or intermediate filaments, visible in the top-left corner. These filaments appear as elongated, linear densities that maintain their trajectory and relative positions across all three slices, confirming their filamentous nature in 3D. No distinct double-membrane organelles like mitochondria are visible in the corners of these specific slices. The only clear double-membrane structure is the autophagosome-like vesicle associated with the central MVB.\n\n3.  **Presence of Key Structures:**\n    The cytoplasm is densely packed with macromolecules, including ribosomes, which appear as small, dark puncta throughout the field of view.
