This is characterized by a limiting membrane enclosing smaller intraluminal vesicles (ILVs).\n    *   **Slice 1 (z187):** The MVB appears as two large, associated vesicular profiles. The lower vesicle contains a small membrane invagination, which is the nascent stage of an ILV. To the left of the MVB, a C-shaped membrane (a phagophore or isolation membrane) and a smaller, fully enclosed double-membraned vesicle (a nascent autophagosome) are visible. This complex suggests active autophagy is occurring in proximity to, or in the process of fusing with, the endosomal system.\n    *   **Slice 2 (z192):** The overall structure is maintained. The invagination within the lower vesicle is more pronounced. The associated autophagosome to the left is clearly defined, showcasing its characteristic double membrane.\n    *   **Slice 3 (z197):** The invagination in the lower vesicle has fully pinched off, now appearing as a distinct ILV. The upper large vesicle is slightly smaller in diameter, indicating that we are moving towards the edge of this structure in the z-axis. The associated autophagosome is still present, confirming its 3D volume. The sequence clearly captures a snapshot of ILV formation within an MVB.\n\n2.  **Continuity of Corner Structures:**\n    The prompt asks to verify double-membrane structures in the corners. Upon close inspection, the most prominent and consistent structures are not double-membraned organelles but **cytoskeletal filaments**, likely actin or intermediate filaments, visible in the top-left corner. These filaments appear as elongated, linear densities that maintain their trajectory and relative positions across all three slices, confirming their filamentous nature in 3D. No distinct double-membrane organelles like mitochondria are visible in the corners of these specific slices. The only clear double-membrane structure is the autophagosome-like vesicle associated with the central MVB.\n\n3.  **Presence of Key Structures:**\n    The cytoplasm is densely packed with macromolecules, including ribosomes, which appear as small, dark puncta throughout the field of view. Various single and double membranes related to the central organelle complex are the most prominent features.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Checklist**\n\n**Slice 1 (z187):**\n*   **lysosome:** Present (as a multivesicular body, a late-stage endosome)\n*   **mitochondrion:** Absent\n*   **membrane:** Present\n*   **ribosomes:** Present\n\n**Slice 2 (z192):**\n*   **lysosome:** Present (as a multivesicular body, a late-stage endosome)\n*   **mitochondrion:** Absent\n*   **membrane:** Present\n*   **ribosomes:** Present\n\n**Slice 3 (z197):**\n*   **lysosome:** Present (as a multivesicular body, a late-stage endosome)\n*   **mitochondrion:** Absent\n*   **membrane:** Present\n*   **ribosomes:** Present']"
