Central Organelle Morphology Evolution\n\nThe central structure appears to be a **mitochondrion** showing clear morphological changes across the z-sequence:\n\n- **Slice 1 (z187)**: Shows a mitochondrion with multiple distinct compartments - a smaller circular profile and two larger circular profiles arranged vertically, suggesting cristae organization or tubular mitochondrial segments\n- **Slice 2 (z192)**: The mitochondrial profile becomes more consolidated, with the compartments appearing more connected, indicating we're moving through a different section of the organelle\n- **Slice 3 (z197)**: The mitochondrion shows a more elongated, interconnected morphology with what appears to be cristae structures becoming more prominent\n\nThis progression suggests we're observing a tubular or branched mitochondrion as we move through sequential z-planes.\n\n### 2. Double-Membrane Structure Consistency\n\nThe double-membrane structures visible in the corners and periphery show good continuity across all three slices, maintaining consistent:\n- Membrane spacing and thickness\n- Overall positioning relative to the central mitochondrion\n- Characteristic double-membrane morphology typical of mitochondrial outer membranes\n\n### 3. Structural Evolution Summary\n\nThe sequence reveals a complex mitochondrial network with dynamic internal architecture (cristae) that changes significantly across the 75 Å z-range (5 slices × 14.985 Å spacing). The organelle transitions from discrete compartmentalized regions to more interconnected tubular structures, consistent with the known 3D complexity of mitochondrial networks in HEK293T cells.\n\n### Final Checklist\n\n**Slice 1 (z187):**\n- lysosome: Not clearly identifiable\n- mitochondrion: Present (central multi-compartment structure)\n- membrane: Present (double membranes visible)\n- ribosomes: Present (textural features suggest ribosomal particles)\n\n**Slice 2 (z192):**\n- lysosome: Not clearly identifiable\n- mitochondrion: Present (central consolidated structure)\n- membrane: Present (double membranes visible)\n- ribosomes: Present (textural features suggest ribosomal particles)\n\n**Slice 3 (z197):**\n- lysosome: Not clearly identifiable\n- mitochondrion: Present (central elongated structure with cristae)\n- membrane: Present (double membranes visible)\n- ribosomes: Present (textural features suggest ribosomal particles)""]"
